# List Operations in Python: Sum of List Items

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a list of numbers.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `sum()` function to calculate the total.
3. Print the result.

## ðŸ§¾ Program

```
list=[10,11,12,13,14]
print(sum(list))
```

## Output
<img width="1186" height="190" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/abb52faa-c0a9-47cf-a8b0-cc8cfdd22cca" />

## Result
Thus the program to write a Python program that calculates the **sum of all elements** in a list is verified successfully.
