# Tuple in Python: Check Element Existence

## ðŸŽ¯ Aim
To write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple.

## ðŸ§  Algorithm
1. Define a tuple `x` with some letters and numbers.
2. Use the `in` operator to check if the string `'n'` exists within the tuple.
3. Use the `in` operator to check if the integer `8` exists within the tuple.
4. Print the results.

## ðŸ§¾ Program
```
x=('n',8,'a','g',2)
check_n='n' in x
check_8=8 in x
print("n in tuple",check_n)
print("8 in tuple",check_8)
```

## Result
Thus the program to write a Python program that checks if the element `'n'` and the element `8` exist within a given tuple is verified successfully.
